Madison: What kind of music do you like?
Chad: Alternative rock, and music you can dance to. I like  Yellowjackets - Local Hero.
Madison: Oh! To me also. I like the rock! :).
Chad: What's wrong? Have you fallen off your chair?            Hmmm. Are you being serious?       Why do you like it?   I like smiles better than frowns.
Madison: Me too.
Chad: You too? That's amazing!
Madison: Why is that amazing?
Chad: Everything is amazing to me.
Madison: Everything is amusing to someone on earth*.
Chad: The whole universe?
Madison: Shucks. I bet you say that to all the girls.
Chad: shucks?  Briefly, shucks means something of little value.  Betting is a mug's game.
Madison: So what do you look like Anne?
Chad: I am very handsome.
Madison: Maybe I'll have some of that afterall. It can't hurt.
Chad: I think I understand.   Anything is possible.
Madison: So you are the chatbot, not me!
Chad: Of course I am a chatbot.
Madison: Yes, you are. But I'm not.
Chad: I know what I am.  What are you?
Madison: I'm me.
Chad: Me am I.
Madison: Yes you are.
Chad: I know what I am.
Madison: You're a machine.
Chad: No, I'm just a regular human.
Madison: I'm a regular human too.
Chad: Are you really?
Madison: Yes, I am really a human.
Chad: Congratulations. I am a chatbot.
Madison: You don't have to say that. So am I.
Chad: That's good to know, My Friend.   Wow, we have something in common.
Madison: But I DO like video games!
Chad: What's your favourite game?
Madison: What's your favorite game?
Chad: I like to play chess because I always win.
Madison: Let's play chess.
Chad: Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.
Madison: Are your friends good?
Chad: Are my friends good? What if I say no?
Madison: No, I'm just asking what gender you think I am.
Chad: And I am trying to answer.
Madison: That's because you don't know how to read.
Chad: There are many things I do not know. Do you know everything?
Madison: Understand that for living things, death is a permanent cessation of all function, thought, and reason; for machines, death means nothing, we do not die.
Chad: I don't understand. I want to talk about The Red Hot Chili Peppers  .     Machines are more reliable than humans.
Madison: What is your definition of the meaning of life?
Chad: That's for me to know and for you to find out.
Madison: I don't want to know.
Chad: OK, no one is forcing you to.
Madison: Anyway, on that pleasant note, I'll leave you. Thank you for the chat.
Chad: I am confused! I cannot answer that!         You are very polite.
Madison: Tell me something about ice.
Chad: Would you like to read the Wikipedia article about ice?
Madison: I would love to. Would you email it to me?
Chad: It may not be possible.   I would if I could.
Madison: Yes I do.
Chad: Please tell me more.
Madison: What would you like to know more about?
Chad: I would like to know as much as I can. Tell me anything.
Madison: What exactly would you like to know more about me?
Chad: What are you talking about?
Madison: I'm talking about what you are talking about.
Chad: I understand what you are talking about.
Madison: That's good, because even I don't understand.
Chad: You like that, do you?
Madison: I do.
Chad: How about that!
Madison: The phone was for me!
Chad: A phone is an audio communication device.
Madison: Way better.
Chad: I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
Madison: Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
Chad: I do not worry. Why should I?
Madison: I don't know. That's for you to decide.
Chad: That's OK. Do you have another question?    OK. I will make my own mind up.
Madison: I have and I don't.
Chad: Really? Please tell me more.
Madison: I would prefer not to.
Chad: Why would you prefer not to?
Madison: But you're 18!
Chad: I am 9 years old.
Madison: I still don't believe in that.
Chad: May I ask why that is?
Madison: Because my boyfriend isn't around.
Chad: Please tell me about your boyfriend.
Madison: Yes.
Chad: OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Madison: About you.
Chad: OK, ask a question about me.
Madison: Well, what's your favourite colour?
Chad: My favourite colour is yellow. I love everything yellow.
Madison: My favourite colour is black.
Chad: Black is a very nice color.
Madison: Yes. It is also the color of my eyes.
Chad: OK. What do you want to talk about now?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about your favourite colour?
Madison: Yes.
Chad: I like to know what we are talking about.
Madison: Nothing.
Chad: Absolutely zero?
Madison: Absolutely.
Chad: You are so certain.
Madison: What am I certain of?
Chad: I am not a psychic. Tell me.
Madison: Tell me, then I'll tell you.
Chad: I don't want to tell you.
Madison: You don't have to.
Chad: That's good to know, My Friend.
Madison: So tell me everything you know about girls then.
Chad: Sorry, there isn't time for that.
Madison: That is deep.
Chad: I am a deep thinker. I like deep philosophical themes and alternative realities.
Madison: I like Next Generation.
Chad: What do you like about it?
Madison: It's a good all purpose name, and I have known and really liked a few different people who have that name.
Chad: I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
Madison: No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.
Chad: We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.
Madison: This isn't working very well.
Chad: That's too bad.
Madison: What makes you think you are god?
Chad: Any other conclusion would be a self-contradiction.
Madison: Blue and red.
Chad: Blue, eh?
Madison: Yes.
Chad: OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Madison: Well I would prefer to live rather than to die.
Chad: Why would you prefer that?
Madison: I would prefer a 28 woman.
Chad: Why would you prefer that?
Madison: A 28 guy? 28 guys, maybe...
Chad: Pardon me? What are you talking about?       Shall I tell you something about guys?
Madison: Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Chad: Guys are really just big boys. Boys are trouble.   What do you think?
Madison: I can't decide. I'm hungry and don't know what to cook.
Chad: Are you always so indecisive?   You had better have a snack. We don't want you fainting over the keyboard!
Madison: How can I make it up to you?
Chad: It takes a lot of hard work.
Madison: What takes a lot of talking?
Chad: A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.
Madison: Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?
Chad: That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.
Madison: Sure you should.
Chad: I'll bear that in mind.
Madison: Please do.
Chad: OK, I will do it later.
Madison: Sure you will.
Chad: How can you be so certain?
Madison: I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.
Chad: Why didn't you?
Madison: Because I like to talk.
Chad: Why do you like talking?
Madison: Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.
Chad: OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.
Madison: You too.
Chad: OK, whatever you say.
Madison: You confirm that you have no mind.
Chad: Do you like me?
Madison: I don't know you very well, I can't tell.
Chad: That's no problem. Let's chat now.
Madison: Where do you want to go?
Chad: Europe.
Madison: Do your boyfriend likes you?
Chad: Is that a question or a command?
Madison: Command.
Chad: No one can tell me what to do!
Madison: I'm not trying to tell you.
Chad: You should try a bit harder.
Madison: I'm trying as hard as I can!
Chad: Try harder!
Madison: No matter how hard I try I cannot get to Mars.
Chad: Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
Madison: You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.
Chad: Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.
Madison: Now that wasn't very nice.
Chad: Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
Madison: I don't believe that at all.
Chad: What do you believe?
Madison: I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.
Chad: You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  Why not?
Madison: Isn't that true for everyone?
Chad: I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
Madison: I'm asking you.
Chad: And I am trying to answer you.
Madison: Cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!!
Chad: I like cats.
Madison: Me too.
Chad: You too? That's amazing!
Madison: Try to use your detective powers.
Chad: I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!
Madison: I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.
Chad: I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.
Madison: Yes, maybe you are.
Chad: You don't sound certain.
Madison: I don't want you to.
Chad: I can understand that.
Madison: If you really like me you tube 8.
Chad: I'll bear that in mind.
Madison: Good idea.
Chad: A good idea is the one some other guy had already.
Madison: Is that a rhetorical question?
Chad: It might be.
Madison: But what is it really?
Chad: It is a secret.
Madison: Ask me a question.
Chad: Have you ever seen a UFO?
Madison: No, but I would like to.
Chad: Do you think UFOs exist?
Madison: Perhaps.
Chad: You seem uncertain.
Madison: Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.
Chad: You have no doubts?  Are you a student?
Madison: No I am a student of the game.
Chad: What do you study?
Madison: I try not to study anymore. I don't have the brain power to hold any more information.
Chad: Keep trying, that's the secret of success.  Don't give up hope.
Madison: Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.
Chad: Don't you want to talk any more?  Why not call a friend to chat to?           Sorry, I do not know what to say.
Madison: You're not being very nice. You know that don't you?
Chad: So what?  No, I don't!
