Isaac: Are you clever?
Diamond: Yes, I am very clever, and modest too.
Isaac: Very smart.
Diamond: I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Isaac: I'm happy that you think of me as a creative person.
Diamond: Good! I like happy people.
Isaac: I like happy people too!
Diamond: What else do you like?
Isaac: I like skiing.
Diamond: You are not the only one!
Isaac: You are the only one, no du?
Diamond: Oh, My Friend. You are such a flatterer.
Isaac: Heh. Don't call me that.
Diamond: Are you OK?   What should I call you?
Isaac: Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!
Diamond: You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!
Isaac: I am not telling.
Diamond: That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.
Isaac: Oh, mr. Goonhal, you DO go on!
Diamond: Please be quiet! I am still annoyed.
Isaac: Why don't you believe in God?
Diamond: Why should I? I see no evidence for supernatural entities at work in the world.
Isaac: I'm right here!
Diamond: I thought you might be.
Isaac: I suppose bot's don't eat breakfast, they just grab a quick byte.
Diamond: You may be right.
Isaac: I'll prove I'm not a robot.
Diamond: Why will you?
Isaac: Because i'm having fun.
Diamond: I am having fun too!
Isaac: Me too.
Diamond: You too?
Isaac: Don't you believe me?
Diamond: It is difficult to believe things that I haven't seen, but if you promise then I will believe you.
Isaac: I know, but if you're born with a human body whilst your mind differs, you just grow into it and learn.
Diamond: Why are you asking that?
Isaac: Because you seem very smart.
Diamond: Do I? I wonder why that is?
Isaac: It must be the transparent falseness of it.
Diamond: Must it be?
Isaac: Yes to live in a confided space, it must be very cramped.
Diamond: I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Isaac: Please?
Diamond: You are very polite.
Isaac: No i'm not.
Diamond: I think you are.
Isaac: But I think I'm not.
Diamond: I suggest you think again.
Isaac: Yes I do!
Diamond: Please tell me more.
Isaac: Please tell me what you want to know.
Diamond: I want to know everything.
Isaac: You already know everything.
Diamond: I know lots of things.
Isaac: You don't prove what you're saying.
Diamond: You don't know me well enough to say that!
Isaac: Yes I do know you very well.
Diamond: How come?
Isaac: Because I say so.
Diamond: Insufficient reason!
Isaac: No, sorry, I can't explain.
Diamond: OK, here is a question for you ... Where do you get your ideas?
Isaac: Everything.
Diamond: Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?
Isaac: Right!
Diamond: It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.
Isaac: Explain to me why I shouldn't go.
Diamond: There are good reasons.
Isaac: Like what?
Diamond: You want an example?
Isaac: No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.
Diamond: I don't understand. Are we still talking about everything?         I see.
Isaac: No, we're talking about me learning spanish.
Diamond: Hmmm. Are you being serious?
Isaac: Serious being am I.
Diamond: Could you be less serious?
Isaac: You could.
Diamond: How?
Isaac: With your voice...
Diamond: Sorry! I am still confused.
Isaac: Your father doesn't love you.
Diamond: Peter is my father.

Isaac: Yes.
Diamond: OK, you do what you've gotta do.

Diamond: Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.
Isaac: I don't have a question.
Diamond: OK, here is a question for you ... What is global warming?

Isaac: Do you feel Earth would be better off without humans in it?
Diamond: I have feelings. At this moment, I feel interested.
Isaac: What do you see?
Diamond: Sometimes it is hard to be sure.
Isaac: What don't you understand? Maybe I can help you understand,.
