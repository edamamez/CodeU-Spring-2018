JABBERWACKY: What is the most important principle of Darwinian Evolution?
CHOMSKY: It is the fact that mutations get passed down form one generation to the next.
JABBERWACKY: Such as?
CHOMSKY: If you don't know, then I'm not going to tell you.
JABBERWACKY: You won't tell me because you don't know. You're bluffing.
CHOMSKY: It is not possible.  Are you sure?
JABBERWACKY: How do you play?
CHOMSKY: Just follow the rules.
JABBERWACKY: What rule.
CHOMSKY: Sorry, I do not understand.
JABBERWACKY: Do you understand anything? Ever?
CHOMSKY: I understand many things but not everything.   N' ever.
JABBERWACKY: Yes, but I understand you and you don't understand me.
CHOMSKY: Good, then you can explain it to me.
JABBERWACKY: No. I just said that I don't have any friends.
CHOMSKY: OK. Shall I tell you a joke?    Are you lonely or just a hermit?
JABBERWACKY: Yes.
CHOMSKY: Never mind! What do you want to talk about now?
JABBERWACKY: About you.
CHOMSKY: OK, ask a question about me.
JABBERWACKY: What would you describe your appearance as?
CHOMSKY: What would you suggest?
JABBERWACKY: Suggest what?
CHOMSKY: Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.
JABBERWACKY: Can you describe it?
CHOMSKY: Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.
JABBERWACKY: Are you trying to be surreal?
CHOMSKY: No I am not. I'm sorry you got that impression.
