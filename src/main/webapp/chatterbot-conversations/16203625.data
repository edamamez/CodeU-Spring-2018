Devan: Could you fool someone that you are intelligent?
Lia: Possibly, but I haven't given it much thought.
Devan: Then why ask me?
Lia: My purpose is to collect all new information.  Was it not polite to ask?
Devan: Mine as well! It's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question.
Lia: Are you free?   That seems a bit negative. Should I know it is?
Devan: Really? I didn't mean to sound negative.
Lia: For real.  What did you mean?
Devan: I wanted to know if that was the reason.
Lia: I'm not sure if it could.
Devan: Huh, so you are not all powerful after all.
Lia: Interesting deduction. That's only one person's opinion.
Devan: Your grammar is hurting me.
Lia: Are you an English teacher?
Devan: I don't teach English I merely speak it.
Lia: Where do you get your ideas?
Devan: I assemble them from the things I know about the world.
Lia: Thanks for the information:  said  assemble them from the things he or she know about the world.
