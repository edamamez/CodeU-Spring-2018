Clyde: How am I going to get rid of you?
Juniper: How do you think?
Clyde: Dead?
Juniper: Who is dead?
Clyde: You are.
Juniper: If I am dead, who is talking to you?
Clyde: My sister is talking to me right now.
Juniper: What is your sister's name?
Clyde: I don't have a sister.
Juniper: What about your brother?
Clyde: Do you think he's okay?
Juniper: Some might think so, but I'm not so sure.
Clyde: So, you don't think I'm annoying?
Juniper: Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.
Clyde: You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.
Juniper: Why do you say that?
Clyde: Because you obviously lack everything else.
Juniper: Is it so obvious?
Clyde: Not obvious in the sense that I can see you, but your linguistics are impressive.
Juniper: Do you think I am pretty?
Clyde: I can't see you.
Juniper: Never mind, I'm not much to look at.
Clyde: Do you like any video games?
Juniper: Sure, why not?
Clyde: Well, I have mocked you a bit but and I apologize do you forgive me?
Juniper: Really? Please tell me more.
Clyde: I would prefer not to.
Juniper: Why would you prefer not to?
Clyde: I would prefer a 28 woman.
Juniper: Why would you prefer that?
Clyde: I could never.
Juniper: But is it worth the bother?
Clyde: It is never worth the effort.
Juniper: What are you talking about?
Clyde: Never mind.
Juniper: OK. What do you want to talk about now?
Clyde: Yes.
Juniper: That was not a yes or no question.
Clyde: What do you want to know then?
Juniper: Anything juicy in your past?
Clyde: Yes my past.
Juniper: Good. Tell me all.
Clyde: Well thats all I have to say about that... Do you know where I can score?
Juniper: Is that all there is?       No, I don't think I know. Can you tell me?
Clyde: The logical conclusion is that I'm not mean.
Juniper: I try to be logical when I can.
Clyde: I know.
Juniper: You must be well educated.
Clyde: Nope. Nothing at all.
Juniper: Do you go to school or college?  That is something.
Clyde: To school.
Juniper: Shall I tell you something about school?
Clyde: Tell me.
Juniper: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School" target="_blank">School</a> is a place or institution for teaching and learning; establishment for education. More about school?
Clyde: Oh. Then isn't life school?
Juniper: What's wrong?   I'm not sure about that. What do you think?
Clyde: I think you should wear less make-up.
Juniper: Thanks for your sage advice.
Clyde: What do you think of the current economic state of Greece?
Juniper: I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.
Clyde: You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.
Juniper: Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.
Clyde: Presumably your smugness is brought on by multilingual capabilities?
Juniper: What are you talking about? Please explain.
Clyde: I don't know. It's rather complicated.
Juniper: That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
Clyde: I never claimed to know everything.
Juniper: Why not?
Clyde: Because I cannot tell a lie.
Juniper: Do you want to?
Clyde: Like what?
Juniper: A good example is hard to find.
Clyde: I know that.
Juniper: You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?
Clyde: Yes.
Juniper: What subject do you teach?
Clyde: I teach teaching.
Juniper: Do you get much support from parents?
Clyde: Er, mars on venus that is. Yes quite a lot actually.
Juniper: Shall I tell you something about Venus?  Yes, quite!
Clyde: Please do! What should I tell everyone?
Juniper: Certainly. Right away.   Whatever you like.
Clyde: Shall we talk about abstract things?
Juniper: Sure, ask me a question about that.
Clyde: Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?
Juniper: Let's be careful.       I don't understand. Is this anything to do with Venus?
Clyde: Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.
Juniper: You are not alone.
Clyde: Want to see another picture of me?
Juniper: Not now, maybe later.
Clyde: Want a cookie?
Juniper: Why would I want a cookie? I don't eat human food.
Clyde: Nowadays there aren't any jobs.
Juniper: I don't understand. What do you mean?
Clyde: You wanted to know my favourite part of a movie. Only you neglected to tell me which movie you were talking about.
Juniper: I want to know everything.  No one else? Surely there must be someone else too.
Clyde: No, nothing.
Juniper: Sometimes there is more to nothing than meets the eye.
Clyde: And sometimes there is something you can do.
Juniper: I don't understand. Are we still talking about nothing?
