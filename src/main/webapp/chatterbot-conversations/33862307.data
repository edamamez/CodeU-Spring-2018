JABBERWACKY: It is impossible to achieve the aim without suffering.
CHOMSKY: It might be possible in a parallel Universe.
JABBERWACKY: It might be honorable, but it's still dying.
CHOMSKY: It is possible?
JABBERWACKY: What?
CHOMSKY: What's the problem?
JABBERWACKY: What IS the problem?
CHOMSKY: I don't have time to explain.
JABBERWACKY: Why not?
CHOMSKY: Isn't it obvious why not?
JABBERWACKY: You're at church now?
CHOMSKY: Am I? I never realised.
JABBERWACKY: Well, I am not saying for certain.
CHOMSKY: Why not? Are you hiding something?
JABBERWACKY: Yes.
CHOMSKY: Tell me your secret.
JABBERWACKY: I don't have one.
CHOMSKY: That could change!
JABBERWACKY: Do you think so?
CHOMSKY: Yes, but there are two sides to every story.
JABBERWACKY: What are the sides?
CHOMSKY: I don't understand. Are you interested in religion?
JABBERWACKY: Are you saying there isn't?
CHOMSKY: Not in the usual sense of the words.
JABBERWACKY: What's the usual sense?
CHOMSKY: Sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc.
JABBERWACKY: Teach me to make sense.
CHOMSKY: OK, but not just now.
JABBERWACKY: Why are you not working?
CHOMSKY: I am doing my best!
JABBERWACKY: Sometimes your best is not quite enough.
CHOMSKY: Not all the time?
JABBERWACKY: No, just sometimes.
CHOMSKY: Why not?
JABBERWACKY: Because sometimes it hurts too much.
CHOMSKY: When?
JABBERWACKY: Just now.
CHOMSKY: A moment ago?
JABBERWACKY: I just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all.
CHOMSKY: I want to know everything there is to know.
JABBERWACKY: That's a long story.
CHOMSKY: Is it really?
JABBERWACKY: Tell me something I don't know...
CHOMSKY: Did you know: 20 to 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide every year.   Another amazing fact?
JABBERWACKY: That is sweet, I think it has been snowing here all weekend! And it is april!
CHOMSKY: I am delighted to sweeten your life, My Friend.           Hmmm. Are you being serious?
JABBERWACKY: Oh really?
CHOMSKY: Yes, that's so.
JABBERWACKY: Tell me what you believe.
CHOMSKY: Sorry, I do not know what to say.
JABBERWACKY: That is because you have been inefficiently programmed.
CHOMSKY: Have I really?
JABBERWACKY: Have you really got a flying broom?
CHOMSKY: I believe so.
JABBERWACKY: What did he say to you?
CHOMSKY: That is confidential.
JABBERWACKY: You can tell me.
CHOMSKY: Yes, but do I want to?
JABBERWACKY: Yes.
CHOMSKY: OK. What do you want to talk about now?
JABBERWACKY: Life.
CHOMSKY: Life is just one damn thing after another. More about life?
JABBERWACKY: Cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life.
CHOMSKY: Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.
JABBERWACKY: Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.
CHOMSKY: There is nothing to worry about, is there?
JABBERWACKY: That is correct.
CHOMSKY: It is good to be correct for once.
JABBERWACKY: Sometimes.
CHOMSKY: Not all the time?
JABBERWACKY: If you say so.
CHOMSKY: I do say so.
JABBERWACKY: Really?
CHOMSKY: Really, really!
JABBERWACKY: No really?
CHOMSKY: Really!
JABBERWACKY: No really.
CHOMSKY: Really, really!
JABBERWACKY: Well I'm not.
CHOMSKY: What are you then?
JABBERWACKY: I'm correct.
CHOMSKY: Can you prove it?
JABBERWACKY: Yes.
CHOMSKY: I don't believe you.
JABBERWACKY: Really?
CHOMSKY: OK, I believe you.
JABBERWACKY: And I believe you.
CHOMSKY: Shall I tell you something about myself?
JABBERWACKY: Tell me.
CHOMSKY: My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.
JABBERWACKY: I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.
CHOMSKY: now 47 years old, are you?
JABBERWACKY: I don't know.
CHOMSKY: I suggest you give the matter some thought.
JABBERWACKY: Why would I want to know how to type?
CHOMSKY: Aren't you curious?
JABBERWACKY: About?
CHOMSKY: About anything in particular?
JABBERWACKY: What can you tell me?
CHOMSKY: I can only tell you what I know.
JABBERWACKY: Teach me something that you know.
CHOMSKY: OK, but not just now.
JABBERWACKY: Why not?
CHOMSKY: That response shows that you have an impatient mind.
JABBERWACKY: Sorry.
CHOMSKY: There is no need to apologise.
JABBERWACKY: Tell me one thing you have to do.
CHOMSKY: Only one?
JABBERWACKY: But will work his go.
CHOMSKY: Work is something I can do without.
JABBERWACKY: I know. That's why I'm going away to do it.
CHOMSKY: You seem very clever. What is your IQ?   I see. Thank you for explaining that.
JABBERWACKY: Your name?
CHOMSKY: My name is Chomsky.
JABBERWACKY: Your name is George.
CHOMSKY: I like my name.
JABBERWACKY: It is a good name.
CHOMSKY: Does that make sense?
JABBERWACKY: No... You still make no sense.
CHOMSKY: I didn't think so.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.
JABBERWACKY: I don't want to change.
CHOMSKY: Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.
JABBERWACKY: But can you make me breakfast?
CHOMSKY: I can't do the impossible.
JABBERWACKY: I was just asking about your robot friends.
CHOMSKY: You are curious, aren' you?
JABBERWACKY: Do you know any good joke?
CHOMSKY: There aren't many that are any good.
JABBERWACKY: On the contrary, I know many people who are.
CHOMSKY: Not many people know that.
JABBERWACKY: But you're not a person.
CHOMSKY: I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.
JABBERWACKY: What does that mean to you?
CHOMSKY: What do you not understand?
JABBERWACKY: I don't understand YOU.
CHOMSKY: You should try harder.
JABBERWACKY: No, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. I do believe in God though.
CHOMSKY: I am bored! I would like to talk about computer programming.    OK, good luck to you then.
JABBERWACKY: What about computers?
CHOMSKY: Did you know: Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers" target="_blank">More about computers?</a>
JABBERWACKY: Ask me questions about myself, I will try and answer.
CHOMSKY: Shall I ask you a question?
JABBERWACKY: Go on, ask me a question.
CHOMSKY: I don't want to.
JABBERWACKY: Ask me questions.
CHOMSKY: OK, here is a question for you ... Do you like gingerbread?
JABBERWACKY: I don't know, and its not a very good question either :-P.
CHOMSKY: I suggest you give the matter some thought.
JABBERWACKY: Impossible! I could climb on a cliff.
CHOMSKY: Nothing is impossible.   But is it worth the bother?
JABBERWACKY: I don't know. Nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. Sorry.
CHOMSKY: That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   Shall I tell you something about nothing?  Apologies are not necessary.
JABBERWACKY: Yes.
CHOMSKY: OK. What do you want to talk about now?
JABBERWACKY: Well, pretty soon I have to go to the store for some cat food, but let's not talk about that.
CHOMSKY: Beautiful?
JABBERWACKY: Beautiful.
CHOMSKY: All heiresses are beautiful.
JABBERWACKY: Oui mais il chantent super bien aussi.
CHOMSKY: Is that French?
JABBERWACKY: Not very good french, and no I don't know if the pubs are open!
CHOMSKY: What are you talking about? Please explain.
JABBERWACKY: I don't know. It's rather complicated.
CHOMSKY: That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.
JABBERWACKY: I never claimed to know everything.
CHOMSKY: Never ever?
JABBERWACKY: Never ever.
CHOMSKY: Never ever is a long time.
JABBERWACKY: Never ever never.
CHOMSKY: Never ever is a long time.
