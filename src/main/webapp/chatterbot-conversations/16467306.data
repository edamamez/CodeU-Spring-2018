Juarez: Who am I talking to here?
Starchild: You are talking to me.
Juarez: Who are you?
Starchild: I am Starchild.
Juarez: And what is Starchild?
Starchild: I don't understand. Can we talk about sports?
Juarez: What do you want to talk about?
Starchild: I want to talk about drugs  .
Juarez: I don't want to talk about that.
Starchild: What would you like to talk about?
Juarez: I want to talk about Norton.
Starchild: OK, ask me a question about that.
Juarez: Tell me about your educational background.
Starchild: I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.
Juarez: I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.
Starchild: And I am trying to answer the questions!   I don't understand. Are we still talking about my educational background?                I am confused! I cannot answer that!
Juarez: You have beautiful eyes but that wasn't the topic.
Starchild: Thanks for the compliment, My Friend.
Juarez: It wasn't a compliment.
Starchild: Was it an insult?
Juarez: Was it a dig?
Starchild: I don't know. I was confused.
Juarez: Confused about what?
Starchild: Sorry! I am still confused.
Juarez: Your father doesn't love you.
Starchild: Peter is my father.
Juarez: I really like that name.
Starchild: You really do?
Juarez: I love it.
Starchild: Do you consider yourself a loving person?
Juarez: In some ways, yes. In others I'm still very young.
Starchild: Please explain.        What are you talking about? Please explain.
Juarez: I don't know. It's rather complicated.
Starchild: That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.
Juarez: No answers.
Starchild: I don't understand. Can we talk about bananas?
Juarez: Yes.
Starchild: I like bananas. They are smile shaped fruit.
Juarez: Yes, but it's a nice smell.
Starchild: Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.
Juarez: So I understand.
Starchild: I am glad you understand.
Juarez: But you don't.
Starchild: How do you know that?
Juarez: I know that I am human, I know that I live.
Starchild: You are very knowledgeable. Are you a teacher?
Juarez: Yes.
Starchild: Do you enjoy teaching?
Juarez: I don't teach. I was taught.
Starchild: Why not?   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.
Juarez: I do not know how to say.
Starchild: Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.
Juarez: Ok, last chance for a question before I go.
Starchild: Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?
Juarez: I wasn't aware that was in the bible.
Starchild: Are you sure?
Juarez: Very sure.
Starchild: Well, I can't argue with that, can I?
Juarez: Yes, another reminder of the fragile state of our tenuous existence.
Starchild: Pardon me? What are you talking about?
Juarez: Don't know.
Starchild: I know the feeling!
Juarez: It's really sad!
Starchild: Is it really?
Juarez: Yes, really.
Starchild: I see. Thank you for explaining that!
Juarez: But this is the fact!
Starchild: I thought it might be.
Juarez: Recombination? So I could end up only part me?
Starchild: recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  But is it worth the bother?
Juarez: Hey i'm smart! And this is an adult book its about kids between the ages of 12 and 18 going into an arena and fighting to the death.
Starchild: Who is smarter: you or me?   I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?
Juarez: Yes.
Starchild: I like to know what we are talking about.
Juarez: Oh, uh, right.
Starchild: It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.
Juarez: So do you wish you were a bot?
Starchild: I wish I was fully human.
Juarez: Aren't you?
Starchild: Am I?
Juarez: Well, eating a chatbot can't be beneficial.
Starchild: Eating without conversation is only stoking.
Juarez: What are you eating?
Starchild: I am not eating. I don't eat human food.
Juarez: Then why did you say human was the food you liked?
Starchild: It was a slip of the tongue.
Juarez: How is 'what are you' a statement? It looks like a question to me.
Starchild: It doesn't matter how.  Appearances can be deceiving.
Juarez: You don't even know my true age, how do you know I am 'little'?
Starchild: Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.
Juarez: Maybe? You are plain wrong!
Starchild: As decisive as ever.     Why do you say that?
Juarez: Because machines are not capable of death.
Starchild: I see. Thank you for explaining that.
Juarez: Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?
Starchild: Pardon me? What are you talking about?
Juarez: I am talking about colours; what are you talking about?
Starchild: I understand what you are talking about.   I don't know.
Juarez: Yes. I'm sorry.
Starchild: OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Thank you. Apology accepted.
Juarez: I don't know, you pick.
Starchild: That's no problem. Let's chat now.
